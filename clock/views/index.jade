			#desc 
				p The Meaning Clock is an interactive design object that allows people to easily (perhaps frustratingly) quantify the time they see as meaningful. It serves to challenge our need for structured and tracked time, and to force the question â€œWhat's meaningful for <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 800;">me</span>?"
